/*
1. input :- head = [5, 2, 13, 3, 8]
   Explanation :- 
        5 → removed (because 13 is on the right and bigger)
        2 → removed (because 13 is bigger)
        13 → stays
        3 → removed (because 8 is bigger)
        8 → stays
   output :- [13, 8]

2. input :- head = [10, 9, 8, 7]
   Explanation :-
       Each node is greater than everything to its right 
   poutout :- [10, 9, 8, 7]
